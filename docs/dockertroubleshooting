1. docker compose on the docker server is connecting 2 containers

ghibli-app and ghibli-db

docker compose 
------------------------
- ghibli-app ghibli-db -
------------------------

shell each container if you needed to check python logs for instance
docker exec -it ghibli-app sh
or
docker exec -it ghibli-db bash

ghibli-db has bash 
ghibli-app has sh only and very little utilities 

handy to print env data eg connection data for database
docker exec ghibli-db env | grep POSTGRES

docker compose takes care of the persistance of the db data and also restarts the containers if the docker server reboots
the main code for compose is in ci.yml in the github/workflows folder 

2. Each user folder on the server has a copy of 
interactive_db.sh
query_db.sh
change them as you see fit

when you ssh onto the staging server you should see them 
Why ? these are for troubleshooting the environment via the ghibli-app container 
your code queries will use that environment so getting inside it to check stuff is necessary a lot

Bascially library psycopg2 in python is makeing the connection to the DB for you 

interactive_db.sh simply makes an interactive shell via psycopg2 library and python to the postgresql container ghibli-db
query_db.sh does the same but simply takes a sql query and then teminates ( not interactive )

The alternative to query directly the postgressql container is exec on to it 
docker exec -it ghibli-db bash
then launch the psql client to connect to the database ghibli_booking
psql -U ghibli_adm -d ghibli_booking
you have direct client access then 
ghibli_booking=#
